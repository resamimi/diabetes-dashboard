User: What are the feature interactions on the model's predictions on instances with <categorical_feature> equal to <categorical_value>?
Parsed: filter <categorical_feature> <categorical_value> and interact [E]

User: Could you show feature interactions for <categorical_feature> equal to <categorical_value>?
Parsed: filter <categorical_feature> <categorical_value> and interact [E]

User: How do the features interact for the model's predictions on data where <numerical_feature> not less than <number>?
Parsed: filter <numerical_feature> greater equal than <number> and interact [E]

User: For instance <categorical_feature> equal to <categorical_value> run feature interactions!
Parsed: filter <categorical_feature> <categorical_value> and interact [E]

User: How do the features interact with each other on data with <numerical_feature> equal to <number> or greater as true?
Parsed: filter <numerical_feature> greater equal than <number> and interact [E]

User: What are the feature interactions for predicting <categorical_feature> that have <number> <numerical_feature>?
Parsed: filter <categorical_feature> true and filter <numerical_feature> equal to <number> and interact [E]

User: Are there any secondary effects between the features for the model's predictions on instances that have a <categorical_feature> or that have more than <number> <numerical_feature>?
Parsed: filter <categorical_feature> true or filter <numerical_feature> greater than <number> and interact [E]

User: Tell me the feature interactions for instances that have more than <number> <numerical_feature> or are <categorical_feature>?
Parsed: filter <numerical_feature> greater than <number> or filter <categorical_feature> true and interact [E]

User: What are the secondary feature interactions for instances that have a <categorical_feature> or that have exactly <number> <numerical_feature>?
Parsed: filter <categorical_feature> true or filter <numerical_feature> equal to <number> and interact [E]

User: Explain feature interactions for instances that have a <categorical_feature> or that have exactly <number> <numerical_feature>?
Parsed: filter <categorical_feature> true or filter <numerical_feature> equal to <number> and interact [E]

User: In what ways do features interact with each other for the model's predictions on instances that have a <categorical_feature> or that do not have <number> <numerical_feature>?
Parsed: filter <categorical_feature> true or filter <numerical_feature> not equal to <number> and interact [E]

User: What are the feature interactions for the model's predictions on the data?
Parsed: interact [E]

User: how do the features interact with each other for the model's predictions on the data?
Parsed: interact [E]
