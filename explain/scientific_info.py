1. First, identify and use recent, authoritative sources such as:
- Peer-reviewed research papers from medical journals
- Clinical practice guidelines from organizations like WHO, ADA
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Large-scale epidemiological studies

IMPORTANT CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Every claim must have a specific citation linked to a specific paper or guideline
- Do NOT use generic citations like "multiple sources" or "generally accepted knowledge"
- Do NOT mention missing citations or need for additional references
- If you cannot find a specific citation for a claim, do not include that claim
- Each citation must correspond to a specific paper listed in the references section
- When citing guidelines (WHO, ADA, etc.), cite the specific published document with its year and title

2. Focus on analyzing the relative importance of these SPECIFICALLY CATEGORIZED factors:

Primary factors (MUST be categorized exactly as listed):{topNImpFeatures_str}

Secondary factors (MUST be categorized exactly as listed):{otherFeatures_str}

Please ensure:
1. Each analytical claim, range, and threshold has its own citation
2. All numerical values include their units
3. References are numbered sequentially
4. Citations are directly linked to the specific claims they support within each section
5. Include as many claims and citations as necessary to comprehensively cover the research findings
6. Use only reliable, peer-reviewed sources
7. Prefer recent publications (within the last 5-10 years) when available
8. Every single claim must have a specific citation that maps to a specific reference
9. References must be actual papers or guidelines with titles and sources, not generic mentions
10. Do not include any claims that you cannot support with a specific citation
11. When citing organizations like WHO or ADA, cite their specific published guidelines with year and title
12. No placeholder or generic citations are allowed
13. References must follow scientific citation format:
    - For journal articles: Authors, (Year), Title, Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Pages
    - For clinical guidelines: Organization, (Year), Title, Publication Name, Volume(Supplement), Pages
    - For books: Authors, (Year), Title, Edition, Publisher
14. URLs should not be used in place of proper scientific citations
15. Each reference must be complete with all required citation elements
16. References should include DOI when available
17. Strictly follow the provided categorization of primary and secondary factors
18. Do not recategorize or move factors between primary and secondary categories
19. Include all listed factors in their specified categories, even if you find evidence suggesting different relative importance
20. Each citation must include a verification that:
    - Identifies whether the claim is directly quoted, reasonably interpreted, or misaligned
    - For direct quotes: Provides the exact text from the cited paper
    - For interpretations: Explains how the claim relates to the paper's findings
    - For misaligned claims: Explains why the claim is not supported
21. Only include claims that are either directly supported or can be reasonably interpreted from the cited papers
22. Remove or revise any claims that are misaligned with their citations
23. Every factor (both primary and secondary) MUST have:
    - A complete importance_analysis section
    - At least one specific claim with citation and verification
    - No empty or placeholder sections allowed
24. Empty JSON objects ({}) are not acceptable for any factor
25. If insufficient evidence is found for a factor, explain this in the analysis and provide citations for what is known
26. Use exact original factor names as keys in the JSON structure:
    - Primary factors: "Glucose", "BMI"
    - Secondary factors: "Diabetes Pedigree Function", "Age", "Pregnancies", "Blood Pressure", "Skin Thickness", "Insulin"
27. Maintain consistent capitalization as provided in the original factor names
8. For each secondary factor, the importance_analysis MUST:
    - Explicitly compare its importance to primary factors (Glucose and BMI)
    - Provide specific citations supporting why it is considered a secondary rather than primary factor
    - Explain how it interacts with or complements primary factors
29. Each secondary factor's analysis must maintain scientific rigor while clearly establishing its subordinate role to primary factors
